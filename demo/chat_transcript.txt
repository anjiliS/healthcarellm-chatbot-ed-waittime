Q:
If I have a minor cut, can I go to a walk-in clinic instead?

A:
Yes, you can go to a walk-in clinic for a minor cut. Skip the Waiting Room is an online platform that provides real-time wait time information for walk-in clinics in Nova Scotia (<https://skipthewaitingroom.com/region/ns>). These clinics are ideal for treating non-urgent medical issues when you don't have a family doctor or can't get a timely appointment with them. Keep in mind that some walk-in clinics may require in-person registration even if listed on the site.

However, if your cut is severe, or you think it might be infected, please consider visiting an Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC). UTCs offer care for urgent but non-life-threatening illnesses and injuries as an alternative to emergency departments (<https://www.nshealth.ca/urgenttreatmentcentre>). They can provide treatment for minor cuts that may need stitches, simple fractures or sprains, and other urgent but non-life-threatening conditions.

Please note: This chatbot does not provide medical advice. If you are experiencing a serious or life-threatening condition, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately.
