# ðŸ©º Emergency Department Wait Time and Navigation Assistant Chatbot

This project is a local, AI-powered chatbot that helps users in the Halifax Regional Municipality explore healthcare options, including emergency department (ED) wait times, walk-in clinics, VirtualCareNS, pharmacy care, and more.

The chatbot is built using the **Ollama + AnythingLLM** stack and retrieves information from local, authoritative Nova Scotia Health documents. It is designed as an educational tool to reduce unnecessary emergency visits by guiding users to the most appropriate level of care.
